Things that tripped me out:

- It took me a while to figure out compile:file won't recompile for you.
- Trying to call functions without their namespace before it was confusing for a bit.
- This would really suck if I didn't install erlang-mode before I got started.
- It's not obvious to me, yet, how to use the map function without actually passing in a "fun" expression.
