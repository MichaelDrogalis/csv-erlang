Things that tripped me out:

- It took me a while to figure out compile:file won't recompile for you.
- Trying to call functions without their namespace before it was confusing for a bit.
- This would really suck if I didn't install erlang-mode before I got started.
- Not sure what {return, list} is for re:split.
- It's not obvious to me, yet, how to use the map function without actually passing in a "fun" expression.
- I'm leveraging existing knowledge of the map function a lot. If I didn't have that, this would be confusing for sure.
- While completing step 4, it's still annoying that I can't figure out how to pass a function by it's name.
- The instructions are very good so far.
- I'm seeing why Clojure makes such a big deal about it's sequence abstractions. Erlang's "size" functions just works for tuples, need "length" for arrows. Stumbled upon this as I was using it as my function parameter.
